DES
===

Java implementation of DES for university cryptography course, Java was used because I am using Java for Distributed Applications course and I like eclipse ^.^

Mostly used BigInteger class and String Manipulation to do bit operations

Can be built into an executable JAR and used from Command Line

DES is the Data Encryption Standard, predecessor of the AES block cipher we use today

It is 64-bit and as specified in FIPS Pub 46
